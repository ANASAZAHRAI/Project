To implement the Java microservice to communicate with the ChatGPT API and update the database, I suggest the following steps:

Use Spring Boot for the microservice and set up a basic project structure with the required dependencies, including Maven, Swagger/OpenAPI, and Actuator.

Implement an endpoint that takes the input question from the user as a parameter and creates a ChatGPT request using the provided question.

Call the ChatGPT API using the API key and retrieve the response.

Extract the answer from the response and append the question and answer to a CSV file. For storing the data, you can use Java's built-in File I/O API.

Respond to the user with the answer provided by the ChatGPT API.

Encapsulate the microservice in a Docker container, so that the database is stored in a volume mapping a location in the host to a location in the container, and the data can be persisted even after the container is stopped.

Organize the project in a way suitable for a production environment, including appropriate documentation and code organization.

Create a Git repository to store the source code and relevant documentation.
